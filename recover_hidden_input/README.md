### Challenge

I go to the '/recover' page URL, then right-click to 'inspect' the page. In the 'inspect' tab, I navigate to 'Network' and examine the type; there is a POST request that sends an email and a value. I modify the email value, and the flag is obtained in the script. In Insomnia, I input a random value:

```markdown
Copy code
    mail 10
```

### Vulnerability

The risk here is that an individual could gain access to vulnerable data by simply changing the email value to a slightly different one.
