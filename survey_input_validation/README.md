I go to the '/survey' page URL, then right-click to 'inspect' the page. In the 'inspect' tab, I navigate to 'Sources' and source code. I modify the value of one of the votes to another integer less than 10 and click on it. I obtain the flag.

The risk here is that an external person can modify the source code with any value they want, potentially causing the script to malfunction. This creates a vulnerability that can be exploited.
