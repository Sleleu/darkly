### Challenge

In the feedback page, you can enter things in the name and description fields. I simply wrote "script" and obtained a flag.

```
Copy code
script
```

### Vulnerability

There is a risk of XSS code injection, executing scripts. There is a risk of sensitive data collection and propagation of malicious software.
