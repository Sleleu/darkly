### Challenge

In the robots.txt file, we once again find a tree of links with a depth level of at least 3. It would be too time-consuming to visit all of them because, considering there are 25 files, then 25 more, and another 25 before reaching the README, we have 15625 files to examine.

With this script that recursively traverses the entire tree structure, we can discover a leaf README that may not have the same content as the 34 characters we find:

```python
#!/bin/python3

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def is_file_empty(url):
    req = requests.get(url)
    return len(req.content) == 0

def list_files_in_directory(url, current_path=''):
    req = requests.get(url)
    page = BeautifulSoup(req.text, 'html.parser')
    for link in page.find_all('a'):
        href = link['href']
        if href == '../':
            continue
        if href.endswith('/'):
            new_url = urljoin(url, href)
            new_path = urljoin(current_path, href)
            list_files_in_directory(new_url, new_path)
        else:
            file_name = href
            file_info = link.next_sibling.strip().split()
            file_size = file_info[-1]
            file_url = urljoin(current_path, file_name)
            if file_size != "34":
                print(f"File found: {file_url}")

url = 'http://192.168.56.107/.hidden/'
list_files_in_directory(url)
```
=======
### Vulnerability

The /.hidden folder is often used to hide files in the file system but does not provide real security. There is a risk of unauthorized access and security vulnerabilities.
